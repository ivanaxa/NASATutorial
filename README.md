A website made with Concise CSS as an alternative to Bootstrap

This is a project for my CS290 Web Development course at OSU. Since I had already a lot of experience using Bootstrap in my previous sites, I wanted to try a new CSS library. That's why I've decided to use ConciseCSS. Thier website is located at http://concisecss.com/

Enjoy my NASA APOD website!
